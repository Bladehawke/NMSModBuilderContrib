// Programmatically control what scripts, or parts of scripts, get executed.
// Cannot be disabled, always executed.
//
// All mod scripts have a subfolder with the same name as the script file
// e.g. <app>/Scripts/Mod/(Configure)/
//
// Any files placed in those folders will be included in the mod pak if the
// corresponding mod is executed without throwing an exception.
// Later scripts may replace included files of the same name added by prior scripts;
// if this happens a warning will be displayed in the Build log.
//
// The files must be placed in the proper pak sub-folder
// e.g. <app>/Scripts/Mod/(Configure)/Textures/ColourLUT.dds
// would be added to mod pak as "TEXTURES/COLOURLUT.DDS".
//
// (Configure) can be used as a place to put loose files that you don't want tied to a mod,
// i.e. not tied to script code that you may want to disable.
//
// Mod scripts are executed in the order they appear in the list.
// If the execute order matters then rename scripts (double-click on name in list)
// to get desired order.
